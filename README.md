#### About the project

The idea of this application is to have an app where we can consult gym exercises. In this app we will have two types of navigations, a stacked navigation for public routes and a tabbed navigation at the bottom for private routes. To style this application we will use NativeBase, a library of stylized components to facilitate the creation of the app.
